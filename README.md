# Starting Strength

A project I created to learn more about [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) 1.1 and [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS). It helps you track your [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.com/) progress.

# Instructions

1. download
2. cd to your directory and type `npm install && bower install`, then hit enter
3. type `node src/static/app.js` and hit enter

If you want to play with the code, open a new Terminal tab, type `browser-sync start --proxy "localhost:8626" --files "src/client/*.html"` and hit enter

That new window running on port 3000 is the one you want.
